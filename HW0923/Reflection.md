####What did you learn about working with CSV files and pandas DataFrames in this assignment?

I already had some experience with DataFrames and Pandas from taking DS 4003 last fall, but I had not seen the specific techniques of grouping data that were used in class. A lot of that class was focused on data cleaning and visualization, so we did not learn as many tools for quick and easy data analysis. Skills of exploratory data analysis and data visualization are very critical, especially early on in a data project, where trends within a dataset are less clear.

####What was the most challenging aspect of this assignment, and how did you overcome it?

Because of my prior experience and especially the hands-on examples from Thursday in class, I did not have any difficulty in completing the assignment. There were a couple moments when I needed to debug some code, but the examples from Thursday were very helpful in doing so.

####How do you think the insights gained from analyzing ACC basketball statistics could be applied to other real-world datasets?

As discussed earlier, the tools of exploratory data analysis, especially early on in a data project, are critical in helping to understand data trends. Additionally, being able to group numerical data by categories is very useful. For example, a lot of the datasets I analyze for my research involve categorizing data by different materials and learning about their properties. It is very helpful to be able to find minima, maxima, and other relevant data characteristics and compare across compounds and parameters.
